            <h2>Free for Everyone, Forever</h2>
            <p>CollegeHub was built with a simple idea: education should be collaborative, not competitive. We believe that every student deserves access to the best resources without any cost. This platform is, and always will be, completely free to use.</p>
            
            <h2>Share and Grow Together</h2>
            <p>The real power of this website comes from you. By sharing your notes and reviewing others', you contribute to a growing library of knowledge that helps everyone succeed. We encourage you to share this platform with your friends, classmates, and anyone who could benefit from it. Let's build a stronger, more supportive college community together.</p>
